## üß† Core Features

### **1. Dynamic Option Count**
Automatically determines optimal number of recommendations based on order complexity:

| Complexity Level | Base Options | Logic |
|------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Simple** | 2 | Quick decision-making for straightforward orders |
| **Moderate** | 3 | Balanced comparison set |
| **High** | 4 | More alternatives to manage risk |
| **Critical** | 4-5 | Maximum options for thorough evaluation |

**Adjustments:**
- +1 option for high timeline pressure (urgent orders)
- +1 option for high precision requirements
- Maximum cap at 5 options

### **2. Complexity Analysis**
Multi-dimensional complexity scoring system:

**Complexity Factors (weighted):**
- Process Complexity (25%): Number and sophistication of manufacturing processes
- Material Sophistication (20%): Special materials (titanium, carbon fiber, etc.)
- Precision Requirements (20%): Tolerances and quality standards
- Timeline Pressure (15%): Urgency based on deadline
- Custom Specifications (10%): Custom requirements and special needs
- Quality Standards (10%): Certifications (ISO, FDA, AS9100, etc.)

**Complexity Levels:**
- **Simple (1-3)**: Basic manufacturing, standard materials
- **Moderate (4-6)**: Multiple processes, some complexity
- **High (7-8)**: Advanced manufacturing, tight tolerances
- **Critical (9-10)**: Aerospace/medical grade, extreme precision

### **3. Tiered Explanations**

#### **Summary Level** (Always Provided)
- Match quality assessment
- Top 3 reasons for recommendation
- Confidence level
- Primary strength and concern
- Complexity alignment assessment

#### **Detailed Level** (On Request)
- Score breakdown by category
- Complexity analysis details
- Competitive positioning
- Improvement opportunities
- Risk mitigation strategies

#### **Expert Level** (On Request)
- Algorithm insights and methodology
- Data sources and confidence intervals
- Statistical analysis
- What-if scenarios
- Feature importance weights

### **4. Enhanced Scoring System**
Combines multiple intelligence layers:

Enhanced Score = Base Score √ó 70% + Complexity Adjustment √ó 15% + Personalization √ó 10% + Market Context √ó 5%

**Personalization Factors:**
- Local preference boost (+8%)
- Quality focus boost (+6%)
- Price sensitivity boost (+6%)
- Speed priority boost (+5%)
