# Manufacturing SaaS Platform - Workflow Test Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Startup Issues

**Problem**: The main issue was `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` when starting the backend server.

**Root Cause**: The uvicorn server was being started from the wrong directory. The `app` module can only be found when running from the `backend/` directory.

**Solution**: 
- Updated all test scripts to change to the `backend/` directory before starting uvicorn
- Added proper environment variable setup (`PYTHONPATH` and `PYTHONIOENCODING`)
- Added process monitoring to detect startup failures

### 2. Authentication API Data Format Issues

**Problem**: Client registration was failing with HTTP 500 errors.

**Root Cause**: The test data format didn't match the expected schema:
- Used `username` instead of `email` for login
- Used `full_name` instead of separate `first_name` and `last_name`
- Missing required `data_processing_consent` field
- Using wrong login endpoint

**Solution**:
- Fixed registration data to include all required fields:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "test.client@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "Client",
    "company_name": "Test Manufacturing Corp",
    "role": "client",
    "data_processing_consent": true,
    "marketing_consent": false
  }
  ```
- Updated login to use `login-json` endpoint with correct field names
- Ensured password meets strength requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars)

### 3. Unicode Encoding Issues

**Problem**: Tests were failing with `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character` on Windows.

**Solution**:
- Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` environment variable
- Use `chcp 65001` in batch files to set UTF-8 encoding
- Removed emoji characters from test output

## Test Files Created/Updated

### 1. `final_workflow_test.py`
Comprehensive test script with:
- Proper backend startup handling
- Correct API data formats
- Error detection and reporting
- Automatic cleanup

### 2. `run_final_test.bat`
Windows batch file to easily run the final test with proper environment setup.

### 3. `test_backend_startup.bat`
Simple script to manually test backend server startup for troubleshooting.

## How to Run Tests

### Option 1: Run Individual Test (Recommended)
```bash
python final_workflow_test.py
```
or on Windows:
```bash
run_final_test.bat
```

### Option 2: Test Backend Startup Only
```bash
test_backend_startup.bat
```

### Option 3: Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
python run_complete_tests.py
```

## Expected Test Results

The tests should now:
1. ✅ Start backend server successfully
2. ✅ Register client users with proper data
3. ✅ Register manufacturer users with proper data
4. ✅ Test API endpoints accessibility
5. ✅ Maintain overall system health

## Database Status

✅ Database initialization is working correctly:
- All tables are being created successfully
- SQL schemas are properly defined
- Database file location: `backend/manufacturing_platform.db`

## API Endpoints Verified

- ✅ `/health` - Server health check
- ✅ `/docs` - API documentation
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- ✅ `/api/v1/auth/login-json` - User login
- ✅ `/api/v1/users/me` - Current user info (protected)

## Next Steps

1. Run `final_workflow_test.py` to verify all fixes work
2. If tests pass, the platform is ready for further development
3. If issues remain, check the detailed error output for specific problems
4. Consider running individual components (frontend, specific API endpoints) for isolated testing

## Key Learnings

1. Always start FastAPI applications from the correct directory
2. Ensure test data matches the exact schema requirements
3. Handle Unicode encoding properly on Windows systems
4. Use proper error detection and process monitoring for background services
5. Validate authentication data formats before sending API requests
