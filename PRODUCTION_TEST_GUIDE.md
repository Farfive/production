## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Database with test data capability
- Network access for external integrations

### Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install requests python-dateutil logging
```

### Environment Setup
1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Verify Server Health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure database is running and accessible
   - Run any necessary migrations
   - Clear test data if needed

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
python production_ready_test_scenarios.py
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Run Specific Scenarios
Modify the `run_all_scenarios()` method to run only specific scenarios:

```python
# Run only client and manufacturer workflows
scenarios = [
    self.scenario_1_complete_client_journey,
    self.scenario_2_manufacturer_workflow
]
```

#### Custom Configuration
Update the test configuration in the script:

```python
# Custom API endpoint
test_suite = ProductionTestSuite(base_url="https://your-api.com/api/v1")

# Custom test users
test_suite.test_users["client"]["email"] = "your-test-client@company.com"
```

#### Environment Variables
Set environment variables for different configurations:

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
export TEST_CLIENT_EMAIL="test.client@company.com"
export TEST_MANUFACTURER_EMAIL="test.manufacturer@company.com"
```

## Test Results and Reporting

### Console Output
The test suite provides real-time colored console output:
- ‚úÖ **Green**: Passed tests
- ‚ùå **Red**: Failed tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Warnings or partial success
- üìä **Blue**: Information and statistics

### Detailed Reports
Two types of reports are generated:

1. **Console Report**: Immediate feedback with summary statistics
2. **JSON Report**: Detailed results saved to `production_test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying the logging level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Manual Testing
For debugging specific issues, you can run individual test methods:

```python
test_suite = ProductionTestSuite()
test_suite.setup_test_environment()
test_suite.scenario_1_complete_client_journey()
```

## Best Practices

### Before Running Tests
1. **Clean Environment**: Start with a clean database state
2. **Server Health**: Verify all services are running
3. **Network Access**: Ensure external integrations are accessible
4. **Resource Availability**: Check system resources (CPU, memory, disk)

### During Testing
1. **Monitor Logs**: Watch server logs for errors
2. **Resource Usage**: Monitor system performance
3. **Network Activity**: Check for timeouts or connection issues

### After Testing
1. **Review Results**: Analyze both passed and failed tests
2. **Performance Analysis**: Check response times and bottlenecks
3. **Error Investigation**: Debug any failed tests
4. **Documentation**: Update any configuration or setup issues found

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: Production Readiness Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Start backend
        run: |
          cd backend
          uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
          sleep 10
      - name: Run production tests
        run: python production_ready_test_scenarios.py
      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: production_test_report_*.json
```

### Jenkins Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }
        stage('Start Services') {
            steps {
                sh 'cd backend && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &'
                sh 'sleep 10'
            }
        }
        stage('Production Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'python production_ready_test_scenarios.py'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'production_test_report_*.json'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Test Scenarios
1. Create a new method following the naming pattern `scenario_X_description`
2. Add comprehensive test steps with proper error handling
3. Use the `log_result()` method to record test outcomes
4. Add the scenario to the `run_all_scenarios()` method

### Extending Test Coverage
- Add new API endpoints to existing scenarios
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test with different user roles and permissions
- Add performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Custom Assertions
Create custom validation functions for complex business logic:

```python
def validate_quote_pricing(self, quote_data):
    """Custom validation for quote pricing logic"""
    total = sum(quote_data['breakdown'].values())
    return abs(total - quote_data['price']) < 0.01
```

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Testing Schedule
- **Daily**: Run basic health checks
