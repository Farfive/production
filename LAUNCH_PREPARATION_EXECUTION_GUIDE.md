## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install structlog psutil aiohttp requests

# Check if port 8000 is available
netstat -an | findstr :8000

# Start with different port if needed
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clear cache and restart
npm start --reset-cache
```

### Test Execution Issues
```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/launch-preparation/load-testing/scenarios
```
