# UI Enhancements Summary - ManufactureHub

## üé® Overview

I've successfully enhanced your Manufacturing Platform with a modern, beautiful UI that follows current design trends. The application now features smooth animations, gradient designs, glassmorphism effects, and an overall premium feel.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Module Resolution Error**: Fixed the TypeScript configuration by creating a proper `tsconfig.json` file
2. **Frontend Build**: The React application is now running successfully on http://localhost:3000
