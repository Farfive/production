## ⚠️ **ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION**

### 1. Frontend TypeScript Compilation
- **Current State**: 115 TypeScript errors across 22 files
- **Impact**: Medium - Application still functional but type safety compromised
- **Priority**: High - Should be resolved before production deployment

#### Major Error Categories:
1. **Type Mismatches** (40 errors): String vs number ID inconsistencies
2. **Missing Properties** (25 errors): Interface properties not found on objects
3. **Implicit Any Types** (30 errors): Missing type annotations
4. **API Response Mismatches** (20 errors): Frontend expecting different response structures

#### Critical Files Needing Attention:
- `QuoteNotificationCenter.tsx` (20 errors)
- `QuoteComparisonPage.tsx` (22 errors)
- `ManufacturingPage.tsx` (14 errors)
- `ManufacturerDashboard.tsx` (9 errors)
- `SupplyChainPage.tsx` (9 errors)

### 2. API Response Type Consistency
- **Issue**: Frontend types don't match backend response structures
- **Examples**: 
  - Invoice model missing `orderNumber`, `currency` properties
  - Quote model missing `certifications`, `capabilityMatch` properties
  - Manufacturer model missing various rating properties
